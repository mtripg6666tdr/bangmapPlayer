| :warning: Notice: Project Discontinued |
----|
| Though this repository had been a progress in rewriting in TypeScript, now this project deprecated and this repository doesn't continue and will not receive any updates, because some following reasons: |
| 1. BanG Dream! Project officially intituted "Guidelines regarding uses of BanG Dream! Copyrighted works" recently. According to it, using "Contents" of "BanG Dream! Project" in game-like fan-fiction works is forbidden. Since this repository originally for playing a music game similar with "BanG Dream! Girls Band Party" by using musics implemented in official game app and other music, I judged this repository might be possible to conflict with the guideline. |
| 2. Because this repository uses Bestdori API, whose music map api has updated, the code of this cannot parse map data. |
| I, as a fan of "BanG Dream! Project", will continue support the project. Thanks for everyone who found and have fun of this project, untill the next time to see you again somewhere. |
